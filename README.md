# BotSecurityTest
Cybersecurity School Project where we created a Bot that plays simple color clicking game by itself trying mimicing human behaviour, and analyzed if we could detect it
 
 - Bot programmed in python
 - uses pyautogui to control mouse and keyboard
 - uses openCV functions to apply color filtering on the screen and identify the colored button (much faster than looking through every pixel)
 - tested on a unity game that we made
