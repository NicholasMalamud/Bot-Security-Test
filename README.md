# Bot-Security-Test
Cybersecurity Project, where we created a Bot that mimics human behaviour and plays a color clicking game by itself, and analyzed if we could detect where it was a bot or not
 
 - Bot programmed in python
 - uses pyautogui to control mouse and keyboard
 - uses openCV functions to apply color filtering on the screen and identify the colored button (much faster than looking through every pixel)
 - tested on a unity game that we made, colored squared are randomly generated
